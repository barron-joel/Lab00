# R Markdown

This is an R Markdown document. Markdown is a simple formatting syntax for authoring HTML, PDF, and MS Word documents. For more details on using R Markdown see <http://rmarkdown.rstudio.com>. Creating HTML type documents are 

When you click the **Knit** button a document will be generated that includes both content as well as the output of any embedded R code chunks within the document. You can embed an R code chunk like this:

```{r cars}
summary(cars)
```

# Basic Markdown Commands

Demonstrated here are a few useful commands for how to write a nicely formatted document.

## Headings and sub-headings

Headings and sub-headings can be useful to break-up your report, adding sections to help advise the reader as to what they are about to read. Headings and sub-headings are made by adding the hash-symbol (`#`) at the start of the line. The number of hash-symbols indicate if you want to create a heading (`#`), a sub-heading (`##`) or a sub-sub-heading (`###`).

## Boldface and italics

There may be instances where you would like to highlight a particular phrase or word using either *italics* or **boldface**. To achieve this, surround the text that you wish to emphasis with either a single pair of asterisks to make it in the italics typeset (`*word*`) or a double pair of asterisks for boldface (`**word**`).

## Lists

Creating a bullet pointed list can be achieved by using the `-` or `*` character at the start of the line for each listed item:

- item 1
- item 2
- item 3

You can also use `1.` to create an enumerated list

1. First
2. Second
3. Third

## Mathematical Expressions

LaTeX is a software system that is commonly used for typesetting mathematical expressions. For example, below creates a centered mathematical equation by writing a formula within two dollar characters (`$$`) 

$$y = 2x + 1$$

In-line mathematical expressions, such as the sample mean $\bar{x}$, can be made by typing the LaTeX command `\bar{x}` within a pair of single dollar characters (`$`).

If you wish to learn more, [Overleaf](https://www.overleaf.com/learn/latex/Mathematical_expressions) contains some useful guides on how to write LaTeX code for generating nicely formatted mathematical expressions.

## Embedding R code and output

You can also embed coding chunks within your document. The example below first renders the code in your document, sends the content to `R` to be evaluated, and then renders the output below the code.

```{r}
log(5)
```


This also works for generating plots.

```{r}
x <- seq(from = -4, to = 4, by = 0.1)
y <- x*(x - 2)*(x + 2) + 3
plot(x, y, type = "l")
```

Do not worry if you don't understand what the above code does. Later in the course you will learn how to make prettier images using the `ggplot2` package.
